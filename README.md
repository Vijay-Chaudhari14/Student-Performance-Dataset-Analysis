# 📚 Student Performance Dataset Analysis  
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of High School Mathematics Performance  
*Task 1 – Data Science & Data Analysis with Python Internship*

This project explores a **Student Performance Dataset** containing academic and behavioral indicators for high school students.  
The goal is to analyze which factors influence students' **final grades (G3)** and understand performance trends.

The project uses Python-based data analysis tools such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## 📌 Objectives of the Analysis
- Load and explore the student performance dataset  
- Clean and prepare the data  
- Perform descriptive statistics  
- Visualize academic performance and influencing factors  
- Identify correlations between study habits, attendance, family background, and final grades  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing values  
- Converted categorical variables where necessary  
- Standardized column names for consistency

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 🔸 Grade Distribution  
Visualized using histograms and boxplots to identify trends and outliers.

### 🔸 Correlation Heatmap  
Revealed important relationships between variables like:
- Study time  
- Absences  
- Previous grades (G1, G2)  
- Final grade (G3)

### 🔸 Study Time vs Final Grade  
Students who dedicated more weekly study time generally achieved higher grades.

### 🔸 Absences vs Academic Performance  
Higher absenteeism strongly correlated with lower performance.

### 🔸 Gender-Based Performance  
Compared average performance between male and female students.
